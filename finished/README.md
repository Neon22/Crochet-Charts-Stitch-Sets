This folder contains the set files you need for Crochet Charts.

You only need to download the .set files and follow instructions on the previous page to install on your machine.

# Downloading:
To successfully download the set files you must follow this procedure (or you'll end up with some html in a file pretending to be set file but its no good for anything)
1. click on the .set file you can see in the list of files above this text.
2. It will open in a window replacing this and you will see its size and a clickable link saying "View raw". click on this link and the file will download to wherever your system downloads files.
3. Alternatively you can click on the Download button on that same page and save it where you like.

# Important
DO NOT simply right-click on the file above and save-as. The file will not be the set file but instead a bunch of html.
