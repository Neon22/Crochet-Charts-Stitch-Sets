This folder contains stitch files that are being worked on.
Or folders named after contributors that hold one or more symbols.

When finished they will be moved to the fnished folder and deleted from here.

# Contributing:
You might have a bunch of symbols in svg format or you might have a .set file:
 - you have a set file:
   - If you feel your set is not quite ready then upload it to in-progress folder.
   - Add a text and/or image file indicating what you think needs adjusting. Someone will help you.
   - The text and image file must have the same name as the set (or its all just chaos :))
  - you have one or more symbol files:
    - Please make a subdirectory under 'in-progress' and put all of our files in there.
    - when you upload add the folder name before you add your files.
      - E.g. in-progress/yourname/stitch.svg
As the set is worked on it can eventually be moved into the finished folder and the entries in the in-progress folder removed.

# Guidelines
When uploading a prototype set here please add a txt and/or image file indicating what questions you have that need answering before acceptance into the final folder.

If you think the set is ready then just put "ready" in the text file or text filename. Someone with access can move it to the finished folder.
E.g.
   - for the set named "4-dc cluster set". When you think its done,
   - the text file might be named "4-dc cluster set - ready.txt"

Or if your'e sure its ready, then you can move it yourself and remove it from this folder.

For guidlelines on naming and for places to discuss the files see the main readme in the top level folder.
