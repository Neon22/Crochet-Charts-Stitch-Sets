This folder contains stitch files that are being worked on.

When finished they will be moved to the fnished folder and deleted from here.

# Guidelines
When uploading a prototype set here please add a txt and/or image file indicating what questions you have that need answering before acceptance into the final folder.

If you think the set is ready then just put "ready" in the text file or text filename. Someone with access can move it to the finished folder.
E.g.
   - for the set named "4-dc cluster set". When you think its done,
   - the text file might be named "4-dc cluster set - ready.txt"

Or if your'e sure its ready, then you can move it yourself and remove it from this folder.

For guidlelines on naming and for places to discuss the files see the main readme in the top level folder.
