# Crochet-Charts-Stitch-Sets
A library of user contributed sets of charts for the Crochet Charts program

This repository holds two kinds of set files made for crochet charts.

They fall into two categories - finished, and in-progress:
  - finished files are ready for anyone to use in Crochet Charts and are usefully sized, named, drawn, etc
  - in-progress files are most of the way there but the author maybe has some questions that others can help wth before the set might be considered finished.

If you are a first time contributor you might consider adding your file to in-progress first and then starting a thread on Ravelry(below) or raising an issue here to get some feedback before moving it to the finished folder.

# Using these sets:
To load sets into Crochet Charts follow this procedure:
1. Take the downloaded file and put it somewhere handy on your system
   - perhaps collect them in a new folder under Downloads, if you're on windows.
2. Open Crochet Charts and open the Stitch library under "Tools/Stitch
library" menu
    - you should see all the stitches available to you currently.
    - the "Stitch Source" defaults to "Default Stitches" - which are the originally installed stitches.
    - if you select a different "Stitch Source" you will see all the stitch sets you have imported.
3. On the right hand side you'll see the button "Import Set". Click on that and select the file just downloaded.
4. A new set will be created and you will see all of the stitches available in that set.
    - you will also see that the stitch set is now named (by the author) in the top drop down window. (Instead of Default)
5. Select each stitch you want to include into Crochet charts by clicking on the checkbox next to each item. You do not need to import all the stitches (you can return to install more later)
6. Click on the "Add To List" button on the right hand side. The selected stitches are now available to you and you can close
the stitch library window.

Note that if you do not select any stitches then none will appear in the main stitch selection dialogs and windows in Crochet Charts.

You should now be able to select and use those stitches in the stitch selection window.

# Contributing:
1. If you have a set that you feel is correctly sized, named, and efficient then upload it to the finished folder.
2. If you feel your set is not quite ready then upload it to in-progress folder. 
    - Add a text and/or image file indicating what you think needs adjusting. Someone will help you.
    - The text and image file must have the same name as the set (or its all just chaos :))
3. As the set is worked on it can eventually be moved into the finished folder and the entries in the in-progress folder removed.

# New set guidelines:
1. See the file above (Making stitches in Inkscape) for a procedure to create your own sets using Inkscape, the opensource vector drawing program.
2. Make sure that the set is well named. E.g. "newset" is not a useful name. "DC4 cluster variants" is a good name.
3. Make sure to have named the stitches usefully.
    - E.g indicating US, UK, other naming convention will be useful to users who live in other places.
4. You can ask a question to get clarity by raising an issue here or asking at the ravelry group.
    - Title your question based on your setname. E.g. 4-dc cluster variants improvement suggestion

Crochet Charts opensource code is located here:
   - https://github.com/iPenguin/CrochetCharts
   - Historically it is infrequently updated and hence this approach to aggregating useful stitch sets.
