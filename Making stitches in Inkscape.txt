Making stitches in Inkscape

Version: Inkscape 0.92.4
Authored: Dec 2019

This document will try to outline how to make new Stitches for use in Crochet Charts.
Crochet Charts is located here:
  - http://stitchworkssoftware.com/

New Sets for Crochet charts are collecting here:
  - https://github.com/Neon22/Crochet-Charts-Stitch-Sets
and this is where this document comes from.


Procedure:
-----------

Key points if you already know inkscape:
1. height of stitches is 21.5mm.
2. line width is 0.75mm
3. stitch should be black lines with no fills.
4. make canvas only just big enough to fit the shape in width and height before saving.

If you are new to Inkscape:
1. Open Inkscape
2. Drag an existing svg stitch file onto the inkscape canvas to load it.
  - svg fies located at the github location. Use as a reference for size and style of the new stitches.
3. You can make as many stitches as you like inside one copy of Inkscape.
 - But when it comes to exporting for Crochet Charts, you will be opening a separate inkscape for each stitch.
 - More about this in step 11.

4. You can copy and paste to get two stitches. It's recommended to do this so you can modify one leaving the other for use as a visual reference for height and/or line thikness.
5. select the shape by clicking on it. 
   - make sure the selected tool (on the left hand side of the screen) is "Select and transform" tool (F1 shortcut key)
6. Ungroup the shapes by typing shift-ctrl-G.
   - you should see multiple selection boxes around the component lines of the shape.
7. reposition the lines as needed for your new shape.
8. add new lines using the tools on the left hand side of the screen until you have the shape you need.
9. You can bend lines and move individual endpoints by using the "Edit paths by nodes" tool (F2 shortcut)

10. When you have the shape finished check the following aspects.
   - Is the entire shape 21.5mm tall (width should be proprtional).
      - (select it with the F1 tool and look at the H box on the toolbar. Choose mm if some other unit is selected.)
   - group the shapes making up a single stitch (ctrl G) into a single entity.
     - shift select to collect them and ctrl G to group
   - is the line width 0.75mm for all lines (shift-control-F to get the "fill and stroke" menu).
   - no shapes have fills.
   - make sure colors you use are black(lines) only.

11. Once each shape is finalised its time to save them out as individual svg files.
  - open a new inkscpae (Ctrl-N) or "File/New" under menus   
  - copy a shape from your original document into this new inkscape.
  - move the shape so it is in the lower left corner of the document page.
  - change the document properties to 21.5mm high and 30mm wide.
    - refine the document width and height and move the shape until it fits just inside the page boundaries.
  - save the file as svg.
    - use a filename that does not already exist in the svgs folder on the website.
    - an easy way to do this is use minimal name length and add two initials on the end from your name.
	E.g. - 4-dcv2-MS
	- this will help to keep the files unique and for many variants to exist so you can choose the ones that best suit you.
